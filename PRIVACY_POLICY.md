# SmartPage Toolbox Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

SmartPage Toolbox ("we", "our", "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension operates entirely offline and stores all data locally on your device.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect

SmartPage Toolbox collects the following data, all stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage:

- **Website Content**: Text selections (highlights), screenshots of web pages, and notes you create
- **User Activity**: Clipboard text entries (only when you copy text while the extension is active)
- **Page URLs**: URLs of web pages where you save highlights, notes, or screenshots (for navigation purposes)

### What We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT collect:
- Personally identifiable information (name, email, address)
- Health information
- Financial or payment information
- Authentication credentials
- Personal communications
- Location data
- Browsing history (beyond URLs you explicitly save)
- Keystrokes or mouse movements

## Data Storage

All data collected by SmartPage Toolbox is stored locally on your device using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. This includes:
- Notes (organized by domain)
- Highlights (text selections with context)
- Screenshots (captured images)
- Clipboard history
- Settings and preferences

**No data is transmitted to external servers.** All data remains on your device.

## License Verification

The extension uses Chrome Web Store's Licensing API to verify purchase status. This process:
- Only sends your extension ID and a license token to Google's servers
- Does NOT send any of your saved content (notes, highlights, screenshots, clipboard entries)
- Uses OAuth authentication provided by Chrome

## Data Sharing

**We do not sell, transfer, or share your data with third parties.** All data remains on your device.

## Data Export and Deletion

You can export all your data at any time through the extension's Settings → Export JSON feature (Pro users). You can also delete all data through Settings → Reset Storage.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date.
